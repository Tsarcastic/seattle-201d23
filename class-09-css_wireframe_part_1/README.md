- Announcements
  - ***DEEP BREATH***....... This kind of is a catch-up day for us, and also the day we leave the most wide-open and with the least amount of new content involved. Why?
  - Adult learning cycle: we need time to reflect.
  - The labs on each of the next two days are of much lower intensity than the others this week, and easier to work at on your own, leaving you room to get caught up on the Mon-Wed labs.
  - Thursdays noon-1: Office hours with the Admissions team in the front lounge area, if you'd like to talk with Karinne and/or Mindy about your next steps. Feel free to talk to Sam or the TAs for any general advice you seek.
  - Starting this afternoon, in lab time, Sam will start a series of 15-minute one-on-one meetings with each student to converse about your progress and also address any questions you might have on the course material, etc. With 22 students, this will take a few days.
  - Today we're focused on reviewing and developing a deeper understanding of what we've been building the past three days, and we're shifting our focus for the remainder of the week more to page layout and UI/UX concerns.
  - We know it's been a hard few days, but the class is doing well.
  - It's not to soon to start thinking about final projects. Let's have a brief conversation about that today, because a week from tomorrow you're going to be divided up into teams and starting on your projects.
  - Tomorrow we'll look at some projects from prior classes and talk a bit about what to expect from Project Week.

- [Code Review](#codereview)

Let's make sure to hit a few high-level topics, such as:
  - Project Goals
  - Program Flow
    - What happens when we open the page in the browser?
    - What happens when there is user interaction (such as submitting the form)?
