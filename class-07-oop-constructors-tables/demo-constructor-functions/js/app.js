// Demo for objects to constructors

// Let's make an object literal of one of you:

var student =  {
  firstName: '',
  class: '201d23',
}

// I would need XXX lines of code to model our class this way
// (22 students * XX lines each)

// What if... I had a function to make these many similar objects for me? A function where I could pass in a student's unique characteristics as arguments, and then that function would make the individual objects?

// Something like this would then make Jeff:

var mahClass = [];

function Student(){

}
